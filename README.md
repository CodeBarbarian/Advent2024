# Advent 2024

So this year i decided to do two calendars.

1. Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/2024
2. Try Hack Me (Advent of Cyber): https://tryhackme.com/r/room/adventofcyber2024

In this project you will find the write ups on these challenges.

## Difficulty

### Advent of Code
Advent of Code has a tendency to become quite complex at the end (After Day 15)

### Advent of Cyber
As the Try Hack Me (Advent of Cyber) is aimed at beginners it should not be as difficult, but you never know. It might be a cool way to keep some of the skills sharp.

## Disclaimer
I will not necessary be doing them every day, so if it is like last year, I did the Advent of Code during the holiday break.

I create these repositories to keep track of some of the projects I decide to do during the year. As this one is a simple way to keep track of things.

Happy Hunting, Happy Coding\
